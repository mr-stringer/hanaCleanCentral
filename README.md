# hanaCleanCentral

A centralised maintenance tool for the HANA database.

hanaCleanCentral is based on [hanacleaner](https://github.com/chriselswede/hanacleaner).  This project aims to perform all of the housekeeping tasks performed by hanacleaner but do so in a centralised manner.  Rather than being installed upon each HANA database, hanaCleanCentral should be installed on a central server where it will remotely housekeep many HANA instance.  hanaCleanCentral can perform maintainence on one remote database at a time or many in parallel.
